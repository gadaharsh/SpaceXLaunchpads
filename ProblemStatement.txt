Problem Statement:
You will be building a 2-page mobile application in react-native using SpaceX APIs.
https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API/tree/master/docs

Page 1 will show a list of Launchpads each item in the list represents one launchpad. Each item will show the following details:
1. 	Name
2. 	Details
3. 	Status
4. 	Top 3 launches for that launchpad, in case no launch is available show No Launch Available
Clicking on any launch we will navigate to page 2

Page 2 will show detail about the launch:
1. 	Name
2. 	Details
3. 	Date
4. 	Reused


Test:
      // <FlatList/>
        // <View>
        //     {launchpads.map((launchpad) =>(
                <Text>{launchpad.name}</Text>
            )
            )}
        </View>
        
onPress={() => {
          /* 1. Navigate to the Details route with params */
          navigation.navigate('Details', {
            itemId: 86,
            otherParam: 'anything you want here',
          });
